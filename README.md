# PrintMyMRI
Brain tissue 3D printing workflow 

# Prerequisites

* A Source:
Structural MRI Scan of your Brain (eg. T1WI)

* An awesome segmentation and surface reconstruction algorithm:
[Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall)

* Another comprehensive neurosciecne library to use as a little helper, especially to combine single segmented (subcortical) structures from freesurfer to an integrated surface model.
This works for any collection of segmented Regions and helps to combound them to a single modell e.g. combining left and right hemispheres with the cerebellum and the brain stem:

* Something to smooth the surface of your segmented and combounded model:
[Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/)

* A nice 3d Slicer:

* Optional and a little advanced CAD software for further edits (free for Students):
[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/campaigns/education/fusion-360)
